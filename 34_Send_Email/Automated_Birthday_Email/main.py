# TODO 1: Update the birthdays.csv
# TODO 2: Check if today matches a birthday in the birthdays.csv
# TODO 3: If step 2 is true, pick a random letter from letter_templates
# TODO 4: Replace the [NAME] placeholder with the person's actual name from birthdays.csv
# TODO 5: Send the letter generated in step 4 to that person's email address.
