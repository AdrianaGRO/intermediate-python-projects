# Turtle Mini Projects

This folder contains a series of mini projects designed to help you practice and improve your skills with Python's turtle graphics module. Each script demonstrates a different technique or concept, building up your understanding step by step.

## Official Documentation
- [Python Turtle Graphics Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html)

## Projects Overview
- **01_turtle_draw_dash_line.py**: Draws a dashed line using turtle graphics.
- **02_turtle_draw_a_square.py**: Draws a square with a random color using turtle.
- **03_turtle_drawing_different_shapes.py**: Draws multiple regular polygons (triangle, square, pentagon, etc.) in random colors.
- **04_turtle_random_walk.py**: Simulates a random walk with the turtle, changing color and direction randomly.
- **05_turtle_draw_a_spirograf.py**: Draws a spirograph (overlapping circles in a circular pattern) with random colors.
- **Hirst_painting.py**: The final, larger project—draws a grid of colored dots inspired by Damien Hirst’s spot paintings, using a palette extracted from an image or a preset list.

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. (Optional) For the Hirst painting, install colorgram:
   ```bash
   pip install colorgram.py
   ```
3. Run any script you like:
   ```bash
   python 01_turtle_draw_dash_line.py
   # or any other script
   ```

## Customization
- Change the grid size, dot size, or spacing by editing the variables in the scripts.
- Use your own image for color extraction in the Hirst painting by updating the image path in the script.

## Learning Path
Start with the simple scripts and work your way up to the Hirst painting project. Each mini project will help you master a new aspect of the turtle module!
