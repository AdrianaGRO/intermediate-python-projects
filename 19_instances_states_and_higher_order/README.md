# 19_instances_states_and_higher_order

This folder contains Python projects and exercises focused on the concepts of instances, state management, and higher-order programming, primarily using the `turtle` graphics library. Each script demonstrates a different aspect of these concepts:

## Contents

- **01_etch_a_sketch.py**
  - A simple Etch-a-Sketch drawing program using the arrow keys to move the turtle and draw lines on the screen.

- **02_turtle_race.py**
  - A fun turtle race simulation where multiple turtles race across the screen. Demonstrates randomization and object state.


## Key Concepts
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- State and instance management
- Event-driven programming
- Use of higher-order functions and callbacks
- Interactive graphics with `turtle`
